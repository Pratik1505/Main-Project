The project utilizes Hadoop, Hive, and Spark to analyze extensive historical datasets on energy consumption and
greenhouse gas emissions. By employing advanced regression algorithms like linear and gradient boosting
regression, we develop a predictive framework providing insights into future energy trends and emissions. This
framework aids policymakers, energy firms, and stakeholders in making informed decisions to mitigate climate
change.We start with meticulous data preprocessing using Python, ensuring integrity before storing in the Hadoop
Distributed File System (HDFS). Hive and its query language facilitate data analysis, while Spark enables predictive
analysis through distributed computing. Visualizations of analysis outputs using Tableau offer stakeholders intuitive
representations of key insights
